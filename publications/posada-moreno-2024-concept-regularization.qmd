## Abstract

Concept extraction methods can provide global, human-understandable explanations for deep neural networks. However, the extracted concepts are typically used only for post-hoc analysis. In this work, we propose closing the loop by using the extracted concepts as regularization signals during model training, encouraging the network to learn representations that are better aligned with human-understandable concepts.
