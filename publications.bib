  abstract = {The textile industry is one of the oldest and largest industries in the world. The fields of application for textile products are diverse. Although the technologies for manufacturing textiles are extensively researched, the industry is still highly dependent on expert knowledge. To date, manual process- and machine adjustments and quality control are the norms rather than the exception. Heat setting is used in the process chain to dissolve or selectively introduce tensions from the weaving or knitting process and to prepare the products for digital printing. The correct setting of the machine depends on a large number of different materials-, processes- \& environmental parameters. For each product, the machine has to be set up again by an experienced textile engineer. To ease the training for new workers and shorten the machine setting process, this study aims to use machine learning to facilitate and objectify the setting of the heat-setting process. Machine parameters are generated using an invertible neural network (INN) based on pre-defined target parameters. The results can be used to identify trends in machine settings and respond accordingly. Thus, a reduction of machine setting time could be realized.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing has revolutionized prototyping and small-scale production in the past years. By creating parts layer by layer, a tool-less production technology is established, which allows for rapid adaption of the manufacturing process and customization of the product. However, the geometric freedom of the technologies comes with a large number of process parameters, especially in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), all of which influence the resulting part’s properties. Since those parameters show interdependencies and non-linearities, choosing a suitable set to create the desired part properties is not trivial. This study demonstrates the use of Invertible Neural Networks (INN) for generating process parameters objectively. By specifying the desired part in the categories of mechanical properties, optical properties and manufacturing time, the demonstrated INN generates process parameters capable of closely replicating the desired part. Validation trials prove the precision of the solution with measured properties achieving the desired properties to up to 99.96\% and a mean accuracy of 85.34\%.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used in critical systems, where robustness and alignment are crucial. In this context, the field of explainable artificial intelligence has proposed the generation of high-level explanations of the prediction process of CNNs through concept extraction. While these methods can detect whether or not a concept is present in an image, they are unable to determine its location. What is more, a fair comparison of such approaches is difficult due to a lack of proper validation procedures. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for automatic concept extraction and localization based on representations obtained through pixel-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps. Further, we introduce a process for the quantitative comparison and validation of concept-extraction techniques based on synthetic datasets with pixel-wise annotations of their main components, mitigating possible confirmation biases induced by human visual inspection. Extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.},

  abstract = {The industry 4.0 is leveraging digital technologies and machine learning techniques to connect and optimize manufacturing processes. Central to this idea is the ability to transform raw data into human understandable knowledge for reliable data-driven decision-making. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been instrumental in processing image data, yet, their “black box” nature complicates the understanding of their prediction process. In this context, recent advances in the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have proposed the extraction and localization of concepts, or which visual cues intervene on the prediction process of CNNs. This paper tackles the application of concept extraction (CE) methods to industry 4.0 scenarios. To this end, we modify a recently developed technique, “Extracting Concepts with Local Aggregated Descriptors” (ECLAD), improving its scalability. Specifically, we propose a novel procedure for calculating concept importance, utilizing a wrapper function designed for CNNs. This process is aimed at decreasing the number of times each image needs to be evaluated. Subsequently, we demonstrate the potential of CE methods, by applying them in three industrial use cases. We selected three representative use cases in the context of quality control for material design (tailored textiles), manufacturing (carbon fiber reinforcement), and maintenance (photovoltaic module inspection). In these examples, CE was able to successfully extract and locate concepts directly related to each task. This is, the visual cues related to each concept, coincided with what human experts would use to perform the task themselves, even when the visual cues were entangled between multiple classes. Through empirical results, we show that CE can be applied for understanding CNNs in an industrial context, giving useful insights that can relate to domain knowledge.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become a common choice for industrial quality control, as well as other critical applications in the Industry 4.0. When these CNNs behave in ways unexpected to human users or developers, severe consequences can arise, such as economic losses or an increased risk to human life. Concept extraction techniques can be applied to increase the reliability and transparency of CNNs through generating global explanations for trained neural network models. The decisive features of image datasets in quality control often depend on the feature’s scale; for example, the size of a hole or an edge. However, existing concept extraction methods do not correctly represent scale, which leads to problems interpreting these models as we show herein. To address this issue, we introduce the Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction (SPACE) algorithm, as a state-of-the-art alternative concept extraction technique for CNNs, focused on industrial applications. SPACE is specifically designed to overcome the aforementioned problems by avoiding scale changes throughout the concept extraction process. SPACE proposes an approach based on square slices of input images, which are selected and then tiled before being clustered into concepts. Our method provides explanations of the models’ decision-making process in the form of human-understandable concepts. We evaluate SPACE on three image classification datasets in the context of industrial quality control. Through experimental results, we illustrate how SPACE outperforms other methods and provides actionable insights on the decision mechanisms of CNNs. Finally, code for the implementation of SPACE is provided.},

  abstract = {In the production industry, the digital transformation enables a significant optimization potential. The concept of reinforcement learning offers a suitable approach to train agents on learning control strategies, further advancing automation. While applications training directly on real-world processes are rare due to economical and safety constraints, simulations offer a way to develop and evaluate agents prior to deployment. With the rise of service-based business models, the simulation owner and the machine learning expert are likely to be different stakeholders in a joint project. Due to different requirements for both simulations and reinforcement-learning agents, the stakeholders may be reluctant or unable to grant full access to the respective software. This poses a serious impediment to the potential of the digital transformation. In this paper, a distributed architecture is proposed, which allows the remote training of reinforcement learning agents on a simulation. It is shown that this architecture allows the cooperation between two stakeholders by exposing a suitable technical interface to the simulation. The proposed architecture is implemented for a simulation of the multi-step metal forming process of heavy plate rolling. Furthermore, the implemented architecture is used to successfully train a reinforcement-learning agent on the task of designing optimal parameter schedules.},

  abstract = {While it is apparent that the transfer of knowledge between tasks is beneficial for training efficiency, the application of trained deep reinforcement learning agents to solve new tasks is not trivial. Especially when tasks are differently structured, retraining and fine tuning is not necessarily beneficial. Instead, it is often the most convenient approach to train a new agent from scratch. One potential solution for effectively reusing learned knowledge may be found in hierarchical reinforcement learning. In this paper we investigate the possibility of reusing low-level policies to improve training efficiency when learning manipulation tasks with an industrial robot. We consider four different scenarios and demonstrate for three of them an increased sample efficiency when training a high-level policy on top of pre-trained low-level skills. In the fourth scenario we uncover the reason for a failed transfer to be an ambitious higher hierarchy level enforcing a relearning of the low-level skills.},
