### 4.3 QUISS - Increasing Rail Transport Quality Through Data-Based Damage Pattern Recognition

- **Start Date**: April 27, 2018
- **Tags**: Deep Learning, Data Science, Railway Transport
- **Featured Image**: content/project/quiss/featured.png
- **External Links**:
  - BMDV: https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/qualitaetssteigerung-des-schienenverkehrs-durch-intelligentedatenbasierte-schadmustererkennung-quiss.html
- **Summary**: The aim of the QUISS project was to develop data-based applications using modern data science and artificial intelligence approaches to optimize or support the scheduling and maintenance of rail vehicles.

**Full Description**:

The QUISS project's goal was to create data-driven applications using contemporary data science and artificial intelligence methods. These applications were designed to enhance or assist in the planning and upkeep of rail vehicles. To achieve this, a system was established that integrated various data sources, including freight wagon shock sensors, camera bridge images, GPS location information, and assorted inventory data.

Utilizing this data repository, the project was able to establish and experimentally integrate different scenarios for improved and data-centric maintenance.

This project was funded by the [Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (Germany)](https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/qualitaetssteigerung-des-schienenverkehrs-durch-intelligentedatenbasierte-schadmustererkennung-quiss.html) between 2018 and 2021. It was a collaboration between DB Cargo AG, Inspirient GmbH, and the RWTH Aachen University.

The implementation of these scenarios led to notable enhancements in the availability of rail vehicles. Thanks to the camera bridge image data, it's now possible to spot vehicle anomalies earlier, allowing for timely maintenance.

Enhancing the freight wagon telemetry data with semantic details has increased the precision of estimated mileage, thereby extending the operational lifespan of the rail vehicles. Additionally, combining GPS data with route network information has improved the accuracy of tracking the vehicles' routes.

Impact data is also being used to pinpoint high-stress sections of the railway, helping to minimize vehicle damage. In a separate scenario, AI was used to analyze the relationship between vehicle mileage, workshop durations, and previously gathered insights.

The rail transport sector stands to gain significantly from these project outcomes, as they enhance the scheduling and maintenance processes for vehicles and diminish operational disruptions.

### 5.1 ECLAD: Extracting Concepts with Local Aggregated Descriptors

- **Authors**: Andrés Felipe Posada-Moreno, Nikita Surya, Sebastian Trimpe
- **Date**: 2023-11-22
- **Type**: article-journal
- **Venue**: Pattern Recognition
- **DOI**: 10.1016/j.patcog.2023.110146
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323008439
- **Featured**: Yes
- **Projects**: iop, ce
- **Tags**: Concept extraction, Convolutional neural networks, Explainable artificial intelligence
- **Abstract**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used in critical systems, where robustness and alignment are crucial. In this context, the field of explainable artificial intelligence has proposed the generation of high-level explanations of the prediction process of CNNs through concept extraction. While these methods can detect whether or not a concept is present in an image, they are unable to determine its location. What is more, a fair comparison of such approaches is difficult due to a lack of proper validation procedures. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for automatic concept extraction and localization based on representations obtained through pixel-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps. Further, we introduce a process for the quantitative comparison and validation of concept-extraction techniques based on synthetic datasets with pixel-wise annotations of their main components, mitigating possible confirmation biases induced by human visual inspection. Extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.
- **Summary**: A novel method for automatic concept extraction and localization based on representations obtained through pixel-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps.

- **Abstract**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become a common choice for industrial quality control, as well as other critical applications in the Industry 4.0. When these CNNs behave in ways unexpected to human users or developers, severe consequences can arise, such as economic losses or an increased risk to human life. Concept extraction techniques can be applied to increase the reliability and transparency of CNNs through generating global explanations for trained neural network models. The decisive features of image datasets in quality control often depend on the feature's scale; for example, the size of a hole or an edge. However, existing concept extraction methods do not correctly represent scale, which leads to problems interpreting these models as we show herein. To address this issue, we introduce the Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction (SPACE) algorithm, as a state-of-the-art alternative concept extraction technique for CNNs, focused on industrial applications. SPACE is specifically designed to overcome the aforementioned problems by avoiding scale changes throughout the concept extraction process. SPACE proposes an approach based on square slices of input images, which are selected and then tiled before being clustered into concepts. Our method provides explanations of the models' decision-making process in the form of human-understandable concepts. We evaluate SPACE on three image classification datasets in the context of industrial quality control. Through experimental results, we illustrate how SPACE outperforms other methods and provides actionable insights on the decision mechanisms of CNNs. Finally, code for the implementation of SPACE is provided.
- **Summary**: We introduce the Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction (SPACE) algorithm, as a state-of-the-art alternative concept extraction technique for CNNs, focused on industrial applications.

### 5.3 Scalable Concept Extraction in Industry 4.0

- **Abstract**: The industry 4.0 is leveraging digital technologies and machine learning techniques to connect and optimize manufacturing processes. Central to this idea is the ability to transform raw data into human understandable knowledge for reliable data-driven decision-making. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been instrumental in processing image data, yet, their "black box" nature complicates the understanding of their prediction process. In this context, recent advances in the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have proposed the extraction and localization of concepts, or which visual cues intervene on the prediction process of CNNs. This paper tackles the application of concept extraction (CE) methods to industry 4.0 scenarios. To this end, we modify a recently developed technique, "Extracting Concepts with Local Aggregated Descriptors" (ECLAD), improving its scalability. Specifically, we propose a novel procedure for calculating concept importance, utilizing a wrapper function designed for CNNs. This process is aimed at decreasing the number of times each image needs to be evaluated. Subsequently, we demonstrate the potential of CE methods, by applying them in three industrial use cases. We selected three representative use cases in the context of quality control for material design (tailored textiles), manufacturing (carbon fiber reinforcement), and maintenance (photovoltaic module inspection). In these examples, CE was able to successfully extract and locate concepts directly related to each task. This is, the visual cues related to each concept, coincided with what human experts would use to perform the task themselves, even when the visual cues were entangled between multiple classes. Through empirical results, we show that CE can be applied for understanding CNNs in an industrial context, giving useful insights that can relate to domain knowledge.

- **Abstract**: The increase of integrated logistics is generating the progressive integration of rail transport systems on a global scale. This raises the challenge of the safe and compliant operation of an increasing number of assets. Within this context, inspection of in-service cargo wagons becomes increasingly important. Among the wagon components, the brake pads are essential and must be constantly inspected and timely changed before any failure. This publication presents a novel system for the automated scoring of cargo wagon brakes through image processing and deep learning algorithms. The main goal of this system is to provide insightful information which can improve the observability of assets, as well as enable augmented decision-making in maintenance inspection processes. Through this work, a four-step novel approach is described. First, an image acquisition system was developed. Then, an object detection model is used to extract the important cargo wagon components. Next, images containing the extracted brakes are analyzed to extract the most relevant keypoints of the brakes. Finally, the ratio between the distances of multiple keypoints is used to score each brake and provide insightful information regarding their health. After implementation, the proposed approach is tested and the resulting scores are explored.

- **Abstract**: The textile industry is one of the oldest and largest industries in the world. The fields of application for textile products are diverse. Although the technologies for manufacturing textiles are extensively researched, the industry is still highly dependent on expert knowledge. To date, manual process- and machine adjustments and quality control are the norms rather than the exception. Heat setting is used in the process chain to dissolve or selectively introduce tensions from the weaving or knitting process and to prepare the products for digital printing. The correct setting of the machine depends on a large number of different materials-, processes- & environmental parameters. For each product, the machine has to be set up again by an experienced textile engineer. To ease the training for new workers and shorten the machine setting process, this study aims to use machine learning to facilitate and objectify the setting of the heat-setting process. Machine parameters are generated using an invertible neural network (INN) based on pre-defined target parameters. The results can be used to identify trends in machine settings and respond accordingly. Thus, a reduction of machine setting time could be realized.
- **Summary**: Using invertible neural networks and expert knowledge for parameter prediction in industrial applications.

- **Abstract**: This work wants to contribute to the current research effort of exploiting deep learning models to tackle the problem of state estimation in power systems. In this contribution, we propose first a methodology for generating data-sets in case of few measurements available. The main body of the work investigates the design of artificial neural network with an extensive study on the input-layer, which plays a crucial role in robustness of the estimator. The aim is to compare performances between models which use additional pseudo-measurements in input and those which do not. Simulation results carried out on the IEEE 95-bus system and low voltage to-bus test network support the conclusions of the proposed framework.

- **Abstract**: In recent years, digitalization has progressed strongly in various domains. This includes the digitizing of previously analog data and the capturing of machine data or sensor values. Furthermore, ever larger amounts of open data, such as weather data or railway data, are available. While connecting these different, heterogeneous data sources enables, for instance, predictive maintenance or fleet planning optimization, properly connecting them still poses a big challenge. This work proposes a novel system for rail freight transport, through which the various data sources can be combined in order to improve the quality of the overall rail transport system with the help of micro-services. The system was developed within the publicly funded project QUISS and the feasibility and the added value were evaluated based on various use cases. The infrastructure is built dynamic so that new data sources can be added and new analytics or machine learning methods can be deployed.

- **Abstract**: In various industry sectors all over the world, the ongoing digital transformation helps to unlock benefits for individual components, involved processes, stakeholders as well as the overarching system (e.g., the national economy). In this context, the rail transport sector can particularly benefit from the increased prevalence of sensor systems and the thereby increased availability of related data. As rail transport, by nature, is an integrated transport mode that contains both freight and passenger transport within the same transport network, benefits achieved for the service quality of freight transport also lead to improvements for passenger transport (e.g., punctuality or uptime of rolling stock). This technical paper presents a method to monitor the condition of the existing rail infrastructure as well as the rolling stock by obtaining insights from raw sensor data (e.g., locations and acceleration data). The data is collected with telemetry-units (i.e. multiple sensors integrated with a telematics device to enable data transmission) mounted on a fleet of on-rail freight wagons. In addition, the proposed method is applied to an exemplary set of extracted real-world data.

- **Abstract**: Additive manufacturing has revolutionized prototyping and small-scale production in the past years. By creating parts layer by layer, a tool-less production technology is established, which allows for rapid adaption of the manufacturing process and customization of the product. However, the geometric freedom of the technologies comes with a large number of process parameters, especially in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), all of which influence the resulting part's properties. Since those parameters show interdependencies and non-linearities, choosing a suitable set to create the desired part properties is not trivial. This study demonstrates the use of Invertible Neural Networks (INN) for generating process parameters objectively. By specifying the desired part in the categories of mechanical properties, optical properties and manufacturing time, the demonstrated INN generates process parameters capable of closely replicating the desired part. Validation trials prove the precision of the solution with measured properties achieving the desired properties to up to 99.96% and a mean accuracy of 85.34%.

- **Abstract**: In the production industry, the digital transformation enables a significant optimization potential. The concept of reinforcement learning offers a suitable approach to train agents on learning control strategies, further advancing automation. While applications training directly on real-world processes are rare due to economical and safety constraints, simulations offer a way to develop and evaluate agents prior to deployment. With the rise of service-based business models, the simulation owner and the machine learning expert are likely to be different stakeholders in a joint project. Due to different requirements for both simulations and reinforcement-learning agents, the stakeholders may be reluctant or unable to grant full access to the respective software. This poses a serious impediment to the potential of the digital transformation. In this paper, a distributed architecture is proposed, which allows the remote training of reinforcement learning agents on a simulation. It is shown that this architecture allows the cooperation between two stakeholders by exposing a suitable technical interface to the simulation. The proposed architecture is implemented for a simulation of the multi-step metal forming process of heavy plate rolling. Furthermore, the implemented architecture is used to successfully train a reinforcement-learning agent on the task of designing optimal parameter schedules.
- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a distributed architecture which allows the remote training of reinforcement learning agents on a simulation.

### 5.13 Transfer of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Structures for Robotic Manipulation Tasks

- **Abstract**: While it is apparent that the transfer of knowledge between tasks is beneficial for training efficiency, the application of trained deep reinforcement learning agents to solve new tasks is not trivial. Especially when tasks are differently structured, retraining and fine tuning is not necessarily beneficial. Instead, it is often the most convenient approach to train a new agent from scratch. One potential solution for effectively reusing learned knowledge may be found in hierarchical reinforcement learning. In this paper we investigate the possibility of reusing low-level policies to improve training efficiency when learning manipulation tasks with an industrial robot. We consider four different scenarios and demonstrate for three of them an increased sample efficiency when training a high-level policy on top of pre-trained low-level skills. In the fourth scenario we uncover the reason for a failed transfer to be an ambitious higher hierarchy level enforcing a relearning of the low-level skills.

- **Abstract**: Explainable AI Planning (XAIP), a subfield of xAI, offers a variety of methods to interpret the behavior of autonomous systems. A recent "pointwise-in-time" explanation method, called Rule Status Assessment (RSA), characterizes an agent's behavior at individual time steps in a trajectory using linear temporal logic (LTL) rules. In this work, RSA is applied for the first time in a reinforcement learning (RL) context. We first demonstrate RSA diagnostics as a substantial supplement to the basic RL reward curve, tracking whether and when specified subtasks are accomplished. We then introduce a novel "Interactive RSA" which provides the user with detailed diagnostic information automatically at any desired point in a trajectory. We apply RSA to an advanced agent at runtime and show that RSA and its novel interactive variant constitute a promising step towards explainable RL.
- **Summary**: A framework for explaining RL agents during training and runtime based the definition of an agents desired behavior through linear temporal logic (LTL).
