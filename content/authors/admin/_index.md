Hi there! Since **September 2024**, I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at the [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~ibtrg/DSME/lidx/1/) (DSME) at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1), focusing on both **Foundation Models** and **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**. I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Sebastian Trimpe](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/DSME/Das-Institut/Team/~jlolt/Prof-Sebastian-Trimpe/?allou=1), and was an associate doctoral researcher at the [Cluster of Excellence "Internet of Production"](https://www.iop.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~gpfz/produktionstechnik/?lidx=1) funded by the [DFG](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/390621612?language=en).

Prior to that, I completed a bachelor's degree in **mechatronics engineering** at the [EIA University](https://www.eia.edu.co/#), a master's degree in **engineering** at the [Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en), worked on agroindustrial applications of IoT and AI at [Asimetrix](https://asimetrix.co/), and worked as a researcher on applied AI at the [IMA Cybernetics Lab, RWTH Aachen University](https://cybernetics-lab.de/en/%C3%BCber-uns).

My research interests lie in the fields of **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**, **Foundation Models**, and **applied AI**. I am interested in the internal representations learned by neural networks, how can they be transferred and how these representations relate to human-understandable concepts. More specifically, I'm focused on methods for concept extraction and active learning and their usage in industrial applications. Recently, I've been exploring foundation models, their latent representations, and how they apply in industrial time-series scenarios.
