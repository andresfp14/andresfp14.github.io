abstract: This work wants to contribute to the current research effort of exploiting
  deep learning models to tackle the problem of state estimation in power systems.
  In this contribution, we propose first a methodology for generating data-sets in
  case of few measurements available. The main body of the work investigates the design
  of artificial neural network with an extensive study on the input-layer, which plays
  a crucial role in robustness of the estimator. The aim is to compare performances
  between models which use additional pseudo-measurements in input and those which
  do not. Simulation results carried out on the IEEE 95-bus system and low voltage
  to-bus test network support the conclusions of the proposed framework.
