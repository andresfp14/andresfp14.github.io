abstract: The Internet of Production (IoP) promises to be the answer to major challenges
  facing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. The lack of inter-company
  communication channels and standards, the need for heightened safety in Human Robot
  Collaboration (HRC) scenarios, and the opacity of data-driven decision support systems
  are only a few of the challenges we tackle in this chapter. We outline the communication
  and data exchange within the World Wide Lab (WWL) and autonomous agents that query
  the WWL which is built on the Digital Shadows (DS). We categorize our approaches
  into
