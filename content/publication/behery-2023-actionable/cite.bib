 abstract = {The Internet of Production (IoP) promises to be the answer to major challenges facing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. The lack of inter-company communication channels and standards, the need for heightened safety in Human Robot Collaboration (HRC) scenarios, and the opacity of data-driven decision support systems are only a few of the challenges we tackle in this chapter. We outline the communication and data exchange within the World Wide Lab (WWL) and autonomous agents that query the WWL which is built on the Digital Shadows (DS). We categorize our approaches into},
