abstract: While it is apparent that the transfer of knowledge between tasks is beneficial
  for training efficiency, the application of trained deep reinforcement learning
  agents to solve new tasks is not trivial. Especially when tasks are differently
  structured, retraining and fine tuning is not necessarily beneficial. Instead, it
  is often the most convenient approach to train a new agent from scratch. One potential
  solution for effectively reusing learned knowledge may be found in hierarchical
  reinforcement learning. In this paper we investigate the possibility of reusing
  low-level policies to improve training efficiency when learning manipulation tasks
  with an industrial robot. We consider four different scenarios and demonstrate for
  three of them an increased sample efficiency when training a high-level policy on
  top of pre-trained low-level skills. In the fourth scenario we uncover the reason
  for a failed transfer to be an ambitious higher hierarchy level enforcing a relearning
  of the low-level skills.
