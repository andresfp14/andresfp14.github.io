abstract: In the production industry, the digital transformation enables a significant
  optimization potential. The concept of reinforcement learning offers a suitable
  approach to train agents on learning control strategies, further advancing automation.
  While applications training directly on real-world processes are rare due to economical
  and safety constraints, simulations offer a way to develop and evaluate agents prior
  to deployment. With the rise of service-based business models, the simulation owner
  and the machine learning expert are likely to be different stakeholders in a joint
  project. Due to different requirements for both simulations and reinforcement-learning
  agents, the stakeholders may be reluctant or unable to grant full access to the
  respective software. This poses a serious impediment to the potential of the digital
  transformation. In this paper, a distributed architecture is proposed, which allows
  the remote training of reinforcement learning agents on a simulation. It is shown
  that this architecture allows the cooperation between two stakeholders by exposing
  a suitable technical interface to the simulation. The proposed architecture is implemented
  for a simulation of the multi-step metal forming process of heavy plate rolling.
  Furthermore, the implemented architecture is used to successfully train a reinforcement-learning
  agent on the task of designing optimal parameter schedules.
