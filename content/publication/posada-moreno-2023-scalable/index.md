abstract: The industry 4.0 is leveraging digital technologies and machine learning
  techniques to connect and optimize manufacturing processes. Central to this idea
  is the ability to transform raw data into human understandable knowledge for reliable
  data-driven decision-making. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been instrumental
  in processing image data, yet, their “black box” nature complicates the understanding
  of their prediction process. In this context, recent advances in the field of eXplainable
  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have proposed the extraction and localization of concepts,
  or which visual cues intervene on the prediction process of CNNs. This paper tackles
  the application of concept extraction (CE) methods to industry 4.0 scenarios. To
  this end, we modify a recently developed technique, “Extracting Concepts with Local
  Aggregated Descriptors” (ECLAD), improving its scalability. Specifically, we propose
  a novel procedure for calculating concept importance, utilizing a wrapper function
  designed for CNNs. This process is aimed at decreasing the number of times each
  image needs to be evaluated. Subsequently, we demonstrate the potential of CE methods,
  by applying them in three industrial use cases. We selected three representative
  use cases in the context of quality control for material design (tailored textiles),
  manufacturing (carbon fiber reinforcement), and maintenance (photovoltaic module
  inspection). In these examples, CE was able to successfully extract and locate concepts
  directly related to each task. This is, the visual cues related to each concept,
  coincided with what human experts would use to perform the task themselves, even
  when the visual cues were entangled between multiple classes. Through empirical
  results, we show that CE can be applied for understanding CNNs in an industrial
  context, giving useful insights that can relate to domain knowledge.
