abstract: Additive manufacturing has revolutionized prototyping and small-scale production
  in the past years. By creating parts layer by layer, a tool-less production technology
  is established, which allows for rapid adaption of the manufacturing process and
  customization of the product. However, the geometric freedom of the technologies
  comes with a large number of process parameters, especially in Fused Deposition
  Modeling (FDM), all of which influence the resulting part’s properties. Since those
  parameters show interdependencies and non-linearities, choosing a suitable set to
  create the desired part properties is not trivial. This study demonstrates the use
  of Invertible Neural Networks (INN) for generating process parameters objectively.
  By specifying the desired part in the categories of mechanical properties, optical
  properties and manufacturing time, the demonstrated INN generates process parameters
  capable of closely replicating the desired part. Validation trials prove the precision
  of the solution with measured properties achieving the desired properties to up
  to 99.96% and a mean accuracy of 85.34%.
