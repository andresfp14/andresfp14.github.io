abstract: 'European Railway companies have to guarantee the safety of their operations as well as compliance with the
  European standards. This includes the diagnosis and maintenance of each wagon during their operations. This
  process is reactive and timely based, which impedes an optimal working schedule of the wagons and hinders the
  lifecycle management of their components. This publication describes the vision of a support system for wagon
  health assessment, a detailed description of the underlying methodology as well as results of the image acquisition
  and object detection steps. Said system aims to assist the overall maintenance process by delivering pertinent
  information regarding the state of the wagons as well as diagnostic results of automated components analysis. The
  proposed system consists of four stages, image acquisition, wagon identification, health estimation, and a decision
  support system.
