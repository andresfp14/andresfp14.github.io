abstract: The textile industry is one of the oldest and largest industries in the
  world. The fields of application for textile products are diverse. Although the
  technologies for manufacturing textiles are extensively researched, the industry
  is still highly dependent on expert knowledge. To date, manual process- and machine
  adjustments and quality control are the norms rather than the exception. Heat setting
  is used in the process chain to dissolve or selectively introduce tensions from
  the weaving or knitting process and to prepare the products for digital printing.
  The correct setting of the machine depends on a large number of different materials-,
  processes- & environmental parameters. For each product, the machine has to be set
  up again by an experienced textile engineer. To ease the training for new workers
  and shorten the machine setting process, this study aims to use machine learning
  to facilitate and objectify the setting of the heat-setting process. Machine parameters
  are generated using an invertible neural network (INN) based on pre-defined target
  parameters. The results can be used to identify trends in machine settings and respond
  accordingly. Thus, a reduction of machine setting time could be realized.
