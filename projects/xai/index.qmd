## Research Overview

This research focuses on making deep neural networks (DNNs) more transparent and trustworthy through **explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)**, with a particular emphasis on **concept extraction**. In critical applications such as industrial quality control, understanding *what* a model has learned and *why* it makes certain predictions is essential for safety, reliability, and human trust.

We develop methods that generate **global explanations** for trained neural network models by automatically extracting and localizing human-understandable concepts. Key contributions include:

- **ECLAD** (Extracting Concepts with Local Aggregated Descriptors): A method for automatic concept extraction and localization based on pixel-wise aggregations of CNN activation maps, with a rigorous validation framework using synthetic datasets.

- **SPACE** (Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction): An algorithm designed for industrial applications that preserves scale information throughout the concept extraction process, critical for quality control tasks where feature size matters.

- **ECLAD-ts**: Extension of concept extraction to the time series domain, enabling the identification and localization of meaningful temporal concepts.

- **Concept Regularization**: Closing the loop between concept extraction and model training, using extracted concepts as regularization signals to encourage better-aligned representations.
