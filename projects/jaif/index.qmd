## Project Overview

The [JUPITER AI Factory (JAIF)](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/jsc/jupiter/jaif-jupiter-ai-factory) is one of 19 European AI Factories established under the [EuroHPC Joint Undertaking](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/). JAIF is built around [JUPITER](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/jupiter), Europe's first exascale supercomputer, hosted at Forschungszentrum Jülich.

The [RWTH AI Center](https://ai.rwth-aachen.de/) is a core consortium partner in JAIF, contributing to foundation model development and talent development within the initiative.

### My Role

At the [Institute for Data Science in Mechanical Engineering (DSME)](https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/), my research within JAIF focuses on **Foundation Models for Dynamical Systems** --- developing transformer-based models pretrained on synthetic data for prediction and control of dynamical systems. This work explores how large-scale pretraining can enable zero-shot generalization to unseen systems, with applications in control and state estimation.
