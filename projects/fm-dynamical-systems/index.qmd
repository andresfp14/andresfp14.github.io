## Research Overview

Foundation models pretrained on large amounts of data have shown impressive performance across NLP and computer vision. This research line investigates whether the same paradigm applies to **dynamical systems** --- can models pretrained on vast numbers of randomly generated systems generalize to unseen target systems?

We explore transformer-based architectures pretrained entirely on **synthetic data** from randomly generated ordinary differential equations. Our findings show surprising zero-shot generalization to new target systems of various complexities for both **state prediction** and **control** tasks. We also investigate combining these foundation models with classical estimation techniques like the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for state estimation.

This work is funded by the [JUPITER AI Factory (JAIF)](/projects/jaif/), part of the EuroHPC JU initiative.
